         <br>
        <p class="font1">Single-use plastics, such as straws, bags, and cups, are a significant contributor to plastic waste. They are discarded after just one use, adding to landfill and polluting our oceans.</p>

  <h2 class="heading2">Improper Disposal</h2>
<p>When plastic waste is not disposed of correctly, it can take hundreds of years to decompose, generating greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. This waste is also a threat to wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
